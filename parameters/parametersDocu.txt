Data structure :
	- ration_test_data : If this parameter appear, it was forgotten. This parameter is not used anymore. 
	- random_seed : seed for the random sequence that will give the index for the input data
	- training_size : size of the boxes used for training

NN Structure:
	- "num_convs":  Number of convolution layers after the inception blocks
	- "num_layers": Number of inception layers 
	- "initial_filter_num": size of the first filter applied


training:
	- "epcoh": Number of training iterations (number of training procedure)
	- "epoch_generator": Number of training iterations for the generator in a training procedure, i.e. for each epoch. 
	- "epoch_critic": Number of training iterations for the critic in a training procedure, i.e. for each epoch. 
	- "display_epochs" : In verbose mode, indicate every each iteration we have to print the progress of the training
	- "display_epochs_critic": In verbose mode, indicate every each iteration we have to print the progress of the critic
	- "display_epochs_generator": In verbose mode, indicate every each iteration we have to print the progress of the critic
	- "learning_rate_generator": Learning rate for the training of the generator
	- "learning_rate_critic": Learning rate for the training of the critic
	- "gp_weight": weight for gradient penalty, 10 works well
